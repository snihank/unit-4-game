The game would definitely make a user make calculative guesses       and work in steps towards a specific number
*   Why the game is useful?
The game is particularly useful to reenergize a player and take some time off. Playing this game everyday for 10 minutes also helps reduce stress. 
*   How users can get started with the game?
There are four crystals, on each click on each crystal, a random number will be generated and added to the total score of the player. If the total score exceeds the the random number generated in the start of the game, the player loses, and the loss count increments by 1. If the score equals to the random number, the player wins and this adds up to the win count. Additionally, when the game  ends,  a new random number is generated and the process begins again. However, to make the wins and losses count to zero, we have to refresh the page.
